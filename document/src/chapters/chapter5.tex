\chapter{Flight Simulator}
\label{sec:fgfs}
For the Autonomous project we have chosen an open-source, multi-platform
flight simulator called \textbf{Flight Gear Flight Simulator}. It was first
released in 1997 under \textit{GNU General Public License} by David Murr. Being
developed by a mature community in an academic environment,  FGFS\abbrev{FGFS}{Flight
  Gear Flight Simulator} has reached in February 2013 version 2.10. Currently
it is being used by various universities and companies for FAA flight simulators
and research projects. Some of the universities that use FGFS are: University of
Minnesota, Department of Aerospace Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University,
University of Naples and University of Toulouse along with ATC Flight Simulator
Company Aerospace Engineering Institute from RWTH Aachen.

Being an open-source product, it offers a high degree of freedom the code being
easy to modify. Because it is written in C++ the code is cross-platform, running
on various different operating systems (eg: Windows, Linux, MAC OS). For
obtaining a higher degree of versatility, Flight Gear is able to use multiple
FDMs\abbrev{FDM}{Flight Dynamics Model}. Independent implementations like
JSBSim and YASim are built as libraries and integrated with FGFS. In our simulations
we have used a drone model called Rascal110 that is provided by JSBSim. The
reason for using the Rascal110 model is that it has similar aerodynamics and
dimensions as the Hirrus drone, for which we are building this autopilot.

An extra reason for choosing the FlightGear Flight Simulator is the fact that the 
central components can be configured by a component called \textbf{Property Tree}.
Each node in the \textit{Property Tree} represent one parameter of one component
and the interaction between components can be assured by changing the values of
the parameters. The \textit{Property Tree} can be accessed in multiple ways.
One of the modes is represented by a web interfaced where the tree can be navigated
and using submit forms the values can be changed. Another is to specify the
desired parameters as command line arguments. At startup FGFS also reads an
external XML\abbrev{XML}{eXtensible  Markup Language} configuration files where
any property can be set. This allows an external user to change the current
status of the aircraft by modifying the directions, the engine parameters or even positions.

To connect to external components, FGFS uses a network communication module
that uses either TCP or UDP sockets. In combination with the \textit{Property Tree}
this module can offer full control for outside sources. The module from FGFS that
is responsible for communication requires an XML file that specifies the message 
formats. In the XML file are specified the formats for both 
\textbf{input} and \textbf{output}. The \textit{output} format is 
usually used to notify the external controller of the aircraft's state, while
the \textit{input} format is used by the external controller to send commands
to control the aircraft. The messages have a C-like format and each value can
be configured to have the needed precision. An example of a XML configuration file
can be seen in \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:qgc.xml}

For these thesis the modules that were mostly used are the \textbf{Autopilot} and
\textbf{Route Manager}. The \textit{autopilot} has a simple interface and supports
commands to specify heading, altitude or speed.For speed and heading changes,
internally, FGFS implements PID controllers.

For ensuring a global environment for all the UAVs, we have used a secondary product
developed specialy for FGFS named FlightGear Multi-Player Server. FGMS is capable of relaying data between
multiple FGFS instances, ensuring a visual representation of all the connected
  drones in the same instance. FGMS acts as a global server, where each
UAV is a client, that sends the telemetry and localization of each UAV to all
the connected clients. This feature is necessary for visually observing the UAVs during the flight 
simulation.

In \labelindexref{Figure}{img:multi-uavs} can be observed from different perspectives 
several UAVs flying in the same environment.

\chapter{Ground Control Software}
\label{sec:qgc}

Another mandatory component for controlling a fleet an UAVs is a ground control
system, that would allow a graphical visualization of the mission and 
flight parameters. For this thesis the chosen ground control system is QGroundControl.

The base version that was used is v1.0.5. Originally QGC was developed
for the PIXHawk quad-rotor drone by Lorent Meier at ETH Zurich. QGC offers supports
for drawing the flight paths on a map and in case of necessity,  
controlling the drones. It is developed in C++ using Qt, making it a cross-platform, 
modular architecture. QGC supports radio-copters, fixed-wing drones and even.
RC cars. For communication with external controllers QGC accepts UDP connections, 
TCP sockets, USB connections and even radio links.

Being developed for MAVs\abbrev{MAV}{Micro Air Vehicles},  QGC uses
an open-source protocol called MAVLink. MAVLink uses a set of standard
messages for communication between MAVs. QGC offers various widgets for facilitating
the use of MAVLink.

MAVLink uses a special message for tracking the integrity of the connected drones
called a \textbf{heartbeat}. This message should arrive at fix intervals
of time. If this message is not received, the drone is considered incoherent
and manual actions have to be taken. Even though other messages are received from
the UAVs, without the heartbeat message, QGC sets them in a state of incoherence.

An useful feature of QGC is the trail path rendered from the previous positions
of the MAV. The trail can be set to have a granularity expressed in seconds or
meters.

QGC is used in different universities and research laboratories across the world 
like: University of Naples, French Aerospace Laboratory ONERA,  University of 
Applied Science of Hamburg.

In \labelindexref{Figure}{img:qgc} can be seen the flight path of 3 UAVs flying
over the Danube near BrÄƒila, Romania.
