\section{Versiunea in Limba EnglezÄƒ / English Version}

In the last decade great advances have been made in the autonomous/independent
vehicles field. In this domain are included flight vehicles. The initial 
purpose of the UAVs was military based, but recently their utility in civil applications
has been made clear. The usage possibilities for UAVs is represented by surveillance
missions, mapping missions, search and rescue missions. Despite all of these
there are still necessary improvements that need to be done, like developing
modules for flight formation and obstacle avoidance.

The \textit{Autonomous UAV} project has the scope of developing of 
a {UAV Management Platform} that is capable of supervising and operating a fleet
of drone from the mission configuration step and until the mission is accomplished.

This thesis focuses on developing a module responsible for the formation and
maintenance of a close range flying formation base on a \textit{follow the leader}
strategy. Being inspired by biological models present in nature,  the agents are 
programmed to autonomously take decisions based on observing the others agents 
actions.
